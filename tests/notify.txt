预期的表现：
远古通知上隐（增加性能：opacity=0以后直接remove）
新通知出现后，旧通知丝滑上移

实现（伪代码）：
define notify:
	add a new notification display (origin style is opaque and transformed)
	get new notification height
	assign this notification to this's notification data

	define x as (get all notification displays as a list)
	for each of the item, as notification, in x:
		if index of notification in x is biggest // technically, equals to x's length minus one
			add an animation, where final stage's opacity is 0.7 (get by query data)
			set a timeout, execute
				if this notification still exist
					add a leaving animation, then
					remove notification()
			after 5000 ms
		else
			decrease notification's opacity in the data
			apply transform style to notification
			add an animation, where final stage's opacity is get by query data
			if notification's opacity is zero:
				add notification into remove list

	remove() all notifications in remove list 

method: addNotificationObj, getTranslateY, getAnimation, remove

核心思路：把初始的状态放在动画外完成
